# Coral-Python-API

# Starting with developing Python API demos 
<br>To setup on the USB accelerator, refer to: https://coral.withgoogle.com/docs/accelerator/get-started/
<br>For running the demos, refer to https://coral.withgoogle.com/docs/edgetpu/api-intro/
<br>Two demos: Image Classification and Object Detection

# Image Classification ()
Accesses classification engine to return a label and score of a classification of an image file

# Object Detection
Accesses Detection engine to return a list of labels found using a certain model, and a copy of the picture 
with box overlays for the detected objects.

# Current Progress
Ran the image classification and object detection demos with the given information
<br> currently trying to learn how to retrain new models using TPU for customized labels
